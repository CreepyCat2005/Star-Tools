# Information

This Project is currently **under development** in a very early stage. It is intended as **universal Star-Citizen platform** for every information out there about the game. It uses its own API to get the latest information about the game. You may ask now why i am making my own API even if there are so many outside I could use? Well, here are a **few reasons** why i use my **own API**:
* Better Perfomance
* Way more accurate data (in most cases)
* Full control about security and serverload
* Quicker bugfixes at the API side
* And more...

# Why is it Public?

I am developing everything by myself including **Frontend, Backend and the Databasemanager**. The big problem about the whole thing is CIG and their **update policy**. Since **nobody knows** when the next **update will be released** I have to code everything in advance and maybe guess the next big content updates. If i wouldn't do that, it may take weeks to bring the newest informations and features into the Software. (The roadmap isn't very helpful becouse we all know the accuracy of it...) 
But you may think now, "haven't you mentioned a database updater?". Yes, i have a databse tool that updates the database every 24h to the newest available informations BUT this only affects the pure data. If CIG is going to bring Salvaging into the game with update 3.18 the Frontend would not be able to process / display the data.

# Why you can't use the software right now

You currently **can't create a new account** / **send requests to the server** because i don't want to end up like Cyberbug 2077 and release an unfinished and unpolished product. If the **first version** is ready for testing and maybe a bit later for deployment **you won't miss it** :)

# You wan't to help? Great!

If you liked the idea and the concept you can help me with the development or just throw in a few ideas :D
